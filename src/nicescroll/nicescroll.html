    <h2> Package Description </h2>

    <p>Release Date: August 10, 2010</p>

    <p>A major advantage of using this driver over those supplied by HP is the direct interface between HPIJS and the
        native CUPS spooler, which allows printing from any printer over any available connection such as USB,
        AppleTalk, TCP/IP (via LPD and IPP), HP JetDirect, and shared windows printers via SAMBA. Additionally, this
        driver utilizes the existing Mac OS X USB &quot;backend&quot; and thus does not install any software that might
        interfere with standard USB operation.</p>

        <h2>Release Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This release fixes a problem with the PPDs that caused many job options such as page orientation,
                color/grayscale mode, duplex printing, etc. to fail.
            </li>
            <li>HPIJS is HP's universal printer driver for most of their non-PostScript printers. It comes as a part of
                HPLIP, HP Linux Imaging and Printing.
            </li>
            <li>The PPDs for HP printers are now sourced from the HPLIP package rather than the OpenPrinting.org
                database.
            </li>
            <li>PPDs for printers from other manufacturers are provided by OpenPrinting.org.</li>
            <li>Some printers are only partially supported. Printers such as<br/>
                HP LaserJet 1022<br/>
                HP LaserJet p1505n<br/>
                HP LaserJet p12014<br/>
                HP LaserJet p2035<br/>
                require a proprietary plug-in for full support. This package does not contain or support such plug-ins.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Printer Set Up Instructions </h2>

        <p>To add a printer queue, Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5.x) users should use the Print &amp; Fax from System
            Preferences. Click on the + (plus) icon at the lower left. A new window will open. In that window, click the
            Default Browser icon at the top left. Highlight your printer in the section below. Use the &quot;Print Using&quot;
            pop-up menu near the bottom of the window to select the correct PPD for your printer and click Add.</p>

        <p>Goggles or safety glasses are forms of protective eyewear that usually enclose or protect the area
            surrounding the eye in order to prevent particulates, water or chemicals from striking the eyes. They are
            used in chemistry laboratories and in woodworking. They are often used in snow sports as well, and in
            swimming. Goggles are often worn when using power tools such as drills or chainsaws to prevent flying
            particles from damaging the eyes. Many types of goggles are available as prescription goggles for those with
            vision problems.<br/>

        <p>History</p>

        <p> Cold weather: Most modern cold-weather goggles have two layers of lens to prevent the interior from becoming
            &quot;foggy&quot;. With only a single lens, the interior water vapor condenses onto the lens because the
            lens is colder than the vapor, although anti-fog agents can be used. The reasoning behind dual layer lens is
            that the inner lens will be warm while the outer lens will be cold. As long as the temperature of the inner
            lens is close to that of the interior water vapor, the vapor should not condense. However, if water vapor
            gets between the layers of the lens, condensation can occur between the lenses and is almost impossible to
            get rid of; thus, properly constructed and maintained dual-layer lenses should be air-tight to prevent water
            vapor from getting in between the lenses.<br/>
            Swimming: Must be watertight to prevent water, such as salt water when swimming in the ocean, or chlorinated
            water when swimming in a pool, from irritating the eyes or blurring vision. Allows swimmers to see clearly
            underwater. They will not be usable more than a few feet underwater, because the water pressure will press
            them tightly against the face. Examples of these include the Swedish goggles.<br/>
            Power tools: Must be made of an unbreakable material that prevents chunks of metal, wood, plastic, concrete,
            and so on from hitting or piercing the eye. Usually has some sort of ventilation to prevent sweat from
            building up inside the goggles and fogging the surface.<br/>
            Blowtorch goggles: These protect the eyes from glare and flying sparks and hot metal splashes while using or
            near as blowtorch. They are not the correct filters for arc welding.<br/>
            Welding goggles: Includes all goggles for eye protection during welding or cutting. They provide protection
            against debris, the heat from welding, and, with the proper filters, the optical radiation resulting from
            the welding, which can otherwise cause arc eye.<br/>
            Motorcycle riding and other open-air activities: Prevents insects, dust, and so on from hitting the
            eyes.<br/>
            Laboratory and research: Combines impact resistance with side shields to prevent chemical splashes reaching
            the eyes. May also include laser protection which would be covered by EN 207 (Europe) and ANSI Z 136 (United
            States). Examples of these include red adaptation goggles.<br/>
            Racquetball: Protect the eyes from racquets swinging in an enclosed area and from impact from hard rubber
            ball.<br/>
            Winter sports: Protect the eyes from glare and from icy particles flying up from the ground.<br/>
            Astronomy and meteorology: dark adaptor goggles are used before going outside at night, in order to help the
            eyes adapt to the dark.<br/>

        <p>Fashion</p>

        <p>Goggles are often worn as a fashion statement in certain subcultures, most often as part of the cybergoth
            subculture. They are usually worn over the eyes or up on the forehead to secure 'falls': a type of long,
            often brightly-coloured, synthetic hairpiece. Fans of the steampunk genre or subculture also frequently wear
            steampunk-styled goggles, particularly when performing in a live action role-playing game.</p>

        <p>Goggles are also frequently used by anime and manga characters as a fashion statement. For example, it is an
            idiosyncrasy of team leader characters in the Digimon anime to wear goggles. Other notable characters who
            wear goggles are the young Naruto Uzumaki and Konohamaru from Naruto, Matt from Death Note and Usopp from
            One Piece.<br/>
